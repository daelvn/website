# come with the water

the stars weren't as bright
as you weren't by my side.
my skin didn't feel calm
as you stayed in your mind.

i got to sing the song that i'd written
but you weren't there to hear it.
i got to cry the tears that i'd save
but you weren't there to soothe them.

i wish... i had... a piece... of you...
i wish... i had... told you... in time...

but i won't ever find you
and i won't ever love you

we were born in the wild
and in the wild we wil die

and i can't ever see you
each time that you die

we were found in the woods
and in the woods we will cry

i'll let you tie me down,
trap me, break me,
let's go wild

it is about all your feral love,
burn me, leash me,
let's burn it all

come with the water
come with the water

here, in my palm, i got something for you.
it is, just a thought, but i save it always dearly.
take, it from me, you can have it always granted.
make, one for me, and i'll place it in my mind

and i won't ever find you
and i won't ever love you

we were born in the wild
and in the wild we will die

and i can't ever see you
each time that you die

we were found in the woods
and in the woods we will cry

come with the water
come with the water
come with the water
come with the water

shed... a tear...
and come with the water
