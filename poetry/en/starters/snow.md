# snow

It only snows when there is
a reason to do so.
It only rains when there is
a path to be walked.

What will it be of me
when it does not rain again,
when the forest stops growing,
when I see the last leaf fall.

We will all regret what we didn't do
and what we could do.
What we did not avoid
and what will make us perish.

And when an animal eats
from your hand you will tell me
that you couldn't,
that you had to kill them.

And when a thunder falls
on your garden you'll tell me
that you are cursed,
that you are a saint.

**We turn into our progenitors**
**and they turn into the dirt we walk.**
