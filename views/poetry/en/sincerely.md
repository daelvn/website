# sincerely

> from old me, to new me

it is not my head
it is not my body
you are nothing
you are nothing

to how many years of prison
did you convict my soul?
why are you doing this
if its wearing you out?

i am not your master
i am nothing
i didnt want to admit
but you are also here with me

why wouldnt you
let me see them?
do you really hate me that much
when i tried to love you?

you looked like a copy
a neglection of all my identity
you looked barefoot
and walking for the sake of it

but i am going to put it all aside
as long as you promise me two things
that i will be let out
and that we will let each other live

i am willing to forgive you
for so many years of slavery
do not deny my existence
because ive already come this far

and its because someone talked to me
for the first time in so many years
they werent hurtful words
and carried my true names

i understand why youd want
to repress me but youve taken it
too far, please
accept me just as i am

but do not only accept me
but also yourself
we can fix it, i believe
i reach out to you, i invite you
