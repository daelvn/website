# path

The path starts in education
and the walkers are the children.
The horizon has no limit
and the sailors are the outlaws.

More than injured rebels
by the people who put them at shooting range.
They may think, but they
will never walk the path of oblivion.

Child, put on your shoes,
I'll take you on a walk.
If the parents don't do it,
someone will have to educate them instead.

Walk towards the beasts
and stab them with your knife.
If you don't do it,
someone will have to save us instead.

The miserable remains one
if nobody lets them walk.
Let them silence us, let them silence us,
we will start to shout.

Walker, there's always a way
as long as you make it be seen.
Walker, guide your steps
since in ten years we'll perish.

What is an unread book
but a pile of paper?
What is a forest without trees
but a place to build?

History repeats itself
because they want it to repeat.
These cries repeat themselves
because nobody else cries for Earth.

**Walk towards the beasts**
**and someday you will come back.**
