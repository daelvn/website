<span>&quot;Why she doesn&#39;t love me so?&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;Try again for me, just go&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;Where did I go wrong?&quot;</span></p><p><span>Your blood painted the moon red.</span>
<span>The symbol of the lovers stained with death.</span>
<span>A look so cruel, bulletproof,</span>
<span>but you weren&#39;t.</span></p><p><span>But you weren&#39;t.</span></p><p><span>// They shot one down but we were there for you. //</span>
<span>// Gunshot wounded, howling at the moon. //</span>
<span>// A night so clear, a moon so red. //</span>
<span>// Stars. //</span></p><p><span>&quot;Homing pigeon, tell me all&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;Why can&#39;t she just love me so?&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;Will I get well tomorrow?&quot;</span>
<span>&quot;It just takes courage&quot;</span></p><p><span>You were angry, showing teeth,</span>
<span>them so sharp and you were hungry.</span>
<span>&quot;There&#39;s no food&quot;, you said bluntly,</span>
<span>and you felt scared.</span></p><p><span>You felt scared.</span></p><p><span>// You hit the wall and shouted at the cruel. //</span>
<span>// The sound of music hunted you for good. //</span>
<span>// We were alone, I told you, &quot;look&quot;. //</span>
<span>// Stars. //</span></p><p><span>We sat down against the wall,</span>
<span>all your friends started to come.</span>
<span>There&#39;s some demons that won&#39;t go,</span>
<span>you had bloodthirst.</span></p><p><span>I told you to look at the sky.</span>
<span>There was no light but there were stars.</span>
<span>You lost control and I saw</span>
<span>the calm that&#39;s coming.</span></p><p><span>The calm that&#39;s coming.</span></p><p><span>// You felt the purple that I built for you //</span>
<span>// Watch the big dipper, in a ground so smooth //</span>
<span>// I wish that I could&#39;ve held your hand //</span>
<span>// Stars. Stars. //</span></p>
