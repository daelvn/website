<span>I am from your head.</span>
<span>Tell me how far</span>
<span>you are from loving me.</span></p><p><span>So many nights</span>
<span>building my castles.</span>
<span>So many fights</span>
<span>going on in my mind.</span></p><p><span>I don&#39;t understand</span>
<span>why I can&#39;t love you.</span>
<span>Maybe I do,</span>
<span>but I don&#39;t accept it.</span></p><p><span>How can I really be so na√Øve?</span>
<span>How could I really do this to me?</span>
<span>Tell me why, tell me why.</span></p><p><span>And I would move the stars,</span>
<span>I would arrange the sky</span>
<span>for us</span>
<span>to constellate.</span></p><p><span>And I would be so proud</span>
<span>to die on your way.</span>
<span>A fake illusion,</span>
<span>to constellate.</span></p><p><span>Perhaps I don&#39;t get it at all.</span>
<span>Perhaps I don&#39;t know what&#39;s going on.</span>
<span>In the sky. In our sky.</span></p><p><span>// Because it&#39;s a pleasure to share //</span>
<span>// and to constellate //</span></p>
