<h1><a name="eternal-body" class="md-header-anchor"></a><span>eternal body</span></h1><p><span>here lies my gravestone,</span>
<span>humid and mossy, forgotten.</span>
<span>its body is already empty,</span>
<span>there is nothing left.</span></p><p><span>my hands feed into the forest</span>
<span>beside me, eternally.</span>
<span>my neck makes the water of the stream</span>
<span>move much strongly.</span></p><p><span>i do not exist corporeally anymore,</span>
<span>but i do exist in the trees,</span>
<span>i do exist in the clouds</span>
<span>and in the lake.</span></p><p><span>i exist in the rain,</span>
<span>i exist in other minds,</span>
<span>in other gravestones,</span>
<span>i will always exist.</span></p><p><span>and when the earth</span>
<span>consumes its last breath,</span>
<span>i know i will be part of a star,</span>
<span>i will turn into its core and its light</span></p><p><span>and if there is life out there,</span>
<span>and they look into the constellation my star forms,</span>
<span>my light will reach them, i will exist with them,</span>
<span>because it travels infinitely without stopping.</span></p><p><span>and the person that puts their gaze in me</span>
<span>will know i am with them, that they have my strength.</span>
<span>i will build my legacy for the eternal</span>
<span>and not for the ephimeral.</span></p><p><span>leaving a trace in life is useless for me,</span>
<span>the only infinite things are stars,</span>
<span>who will welcome me among them</span>
<span>as just another sibling.</span></p><p><span>and the cycle will continue forever,</span>
<span>as long as the sky has stars</span>
<span>and there is someone to watch them</span>
<span>as someone looks at their lover.</span></p><p><strong><span>and you?</span></strong>
<strong><span>have you looked at the stars today?</span></strong></p>
