# drive

Driving away,
none to little faith.
Stars that will light my face,
blades that will cry my death.

I feel alone,
I'm all alone...

Friends I go out with.
Confidence, it's all a myth.

I feel my heart.
Can you feel it now?

One more mile, one more mile
and I'll be out.
Let's not be loud.

One more mile, one more mile
to see the day,
or to fade away.

Things to be undone,
just a mile more.

Make up your mind.
Is this my heart?

Feelings that can't be parsed,
a ground that's so coarse.

I've lost my head,
a war was led.

Nothing feels real,
I'm the one he wants to kill.

I pour my thoughts,
can you see it now?

One more mile, one more mile
and I'll be out.
Let's not be loud.

One more mile, one more mile
to see the day,
or to fade away.

A heart that skips a beat,
a brain that thinks of me.

It's all I need,
just someone here.

// I see the exit //
// I drive out //
// Not my place //
// Not my heart //
// They tore it apart //
// They tore me apart //

One more mile, one more mile
and I'll be out.
Let's not be loud.

One more mile, one more mile
to see the day,
or to fade away.
