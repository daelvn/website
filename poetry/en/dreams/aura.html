<h1><a name="aura" class="md-header-anchor"></a><span>aura</span></h1><p><span>i pronounced the forbidden words</span>
<span>in front of your sacred altar,</span>
<span>and now there was nobody who cared</span>
<span>enough to stop me.</span></p><p><span>shining, your door opened to me,</span>
<span>and you appeared with firm steps.</span>
<span>you came to where i was kneeling</span>
<span>and reached out for me to go with you.</span></p><p><span>behind us a portal opened,</span>
<span>intense blue as your gaze,</span>
<span>and as soon as we walked through it</span>
<span>my feet started to levitate.</span></p><p><span>in a world of teal fumes</span>
<span>everything was surrounded by that substance.</span>
<span>i couldn&#39;t believe what my eyes saw</span>
<span>but you were by my side to guide me.</span></p><p><span>it is then when you taught me that everything had an aura,</span>
<span>and that if i concentrated enough, i would be able to read them,</span>
<span>and know what i could read not only from people,</span>
<span>but also from animals and objects that store memories.</span></p><p><span>with a bit of effort i soon understood,</span>
<span>and something inside me awakened.</span>
<span>the chains that recluded some part of my body</span>
<span>blew up like they had never existed.</span></p><p><span>and then you put me back to earth,</span>
<span>slowly, floating, and now everything had an aura:</span>
<span>the hotel, the tourists, the street had something special</span>
<span>which i had never noticed before.</span></p><p><span>while i fell you gave me your signal</span>
<span>and my power in the world of the mortals,</span>
<span>you trusted that i would know how to use it</span>
<span>in my daily life.</span></p><p><span>and when i started to step on the street</span>
<span>everything moved in slow motion around me,</span>
<span>everything looked more sharp and full of life,</span>
<span>like i had never seen it.</span></p><p><span>it was the tears that woke me up</span>
<span>of such nocturnal trance, and i&#39;m still searching you</span>
<span>in the hideouts of my mind,</span>
<span>waiting to see you again.</span></p><p><em><span>what are you?</span></em></p>
