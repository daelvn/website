<h1><a name="remedy-for-a-broken-heart" class="md-header-anchor"></a><span>remedy for a broken heart</span></h1><p><span>a lie and an &quot;i love you&quot;,</span>
<span>regardless of the order.</span>
<span>a heart and a promise,</span>
<span>that end up broken.</span></p><p><strong><span>i tried to be perfect,</span></strong>
<span>but im never enough,</span>
<span>i want to give all that is in me,</span>
<span>but it never works</span></p><p><span>i tried to heal your cracks,</span>
<span>that they left behind, convince you</span>
<span>that nothing was wrong,</span>
<span>but i couldn&#39;t hold it in</span></p><p><span>i can feel your stare,</span>
<span>behind any screen,</span>
<span>i can feel your depth,</span>
<span>that black that consumes me</span></p><p><span>and i feel at the border of a cliff,</span>
<span>i know that if i keep looking,</span>
<span>i will fall,</span>
<span>and otherwise, you will.</span></p><p><span>i tried to sacrifice myself,</span>
<span>here i am and so i did,</span>
<span>i fell backwards,</span>
<span>sustaining the stare.</span></p><p><span>and i fell for the same problems</span>
<span>that i warned you about</span>
<span>and i fell in the same tricks</span>
<span>from which i tried to protect you</span></p><p><span>i came down to be able to understand you better,</span>
<span>to get close even if distant,</span>
<span>to calm you even if irrelevant,</span>
<span>because i really care</span></p><p><span>but only two kinds of people understand your problems:</span>
<span>those who have your eyes,</span>
<span>and those who you killed with your eyes,</span>
<span>those who you killed</span></p><p><span>im not the only one</span>
<span>in this abyss,</span>
<span>people that i almost don&#39;t</span>
<span>get to understand</span></p><p><span>you saw me fall and i asked you to turn around,</span>
<span>now i dont see you and darkness consumes my eyes.</span>
<span>the spiderweb consumes my mind,</span>
<span>ensuring the most absolute collapse of my state.</span></p><p><strong><span>so many things that i promised</span></strong>
<span>that you knew i was incapable of fulfilling,</span>
<span>for a reason or another,</span>
<span>i cant be happy</span></p><p><span>many things that i told you,</span>
<span>that i now regret,</span>
<span>and now that you&#39;re free</span>
<span>you remember me with bitterness</span></p><p><span>now im just one of them,</span>
<span>someone you thought understood you,</span>
<span>but i lied in so many things,</span>
<span>that i got rid of reality completely</span></p><p><span>broken heart for no reason,</span>
<span>i lost it all for losing one thing,</span>
<span>i wasted it all for wasting your love,</span>
<span>but i cant accept it</span></p><p><span>i ask you to follow your heart,</span>
<span>because it is still full of light,</span>
<span>it still has wings to fly,</span>
<span>and i cant hold it anymore</span></p><p><strong><span>time for you to get rid of me,</span></strong>
<span>time for you to bury me by your tomb,</span>
<span>time for you to look at me for the last time,</span>
<span>time for you to say that it&#39;s all over</span></p><p><span>i know how many they were and now im only</span>
<span>a number,</span>
<span>another person that allowed themselves to hurt you,</span>
<span>even when they didn&#39;t recognize it</span></p><p><span>i was stupid, selfish,</span>
<span>i didnt believe to be the light that really guides you,</span>
<span>but now you move on,</span>
<span>and i lie in my deathplace</span></p><p><span>time for you to forget me,</span>
<span>time for your darkness to consume my eyes,</span>
<span>time for your problems to be mine,</span>
<span>time for your songs to sing my cries</span></p><p><span>i had many attempts,</span>
<span>and i didnt use any of them.</span>
<span>people that mattered to me,</span>
<span>who i would end up destroying</span></p><p><span>and i know you two tried to ignore it,</span>
<span>now i know that nothing was true,</span>
<span>that it really hurt,</span>
<span>that you want to forget.</span></p><p><span>i dont know whether i should move on,</span>
<span>or return to my roots.</span>
<span>whether i should continue,</span>
<span>or face my ghosts.</span></p><p><strong><span>hate me, step on me,</span></strong>
<span>dont remember me as someone who saved you,</span>
<span>break me, destroy me,</span>
<span>dont have me as someone kind-hearted</span></p><p><span>i dont know if im able to hold someone</span>
<span>without hurting them.</span>
<span>i make myself believe not and so</span>
<span>i get into this abyss alone.</span></p><p><span>spit on me, laugh</span>
<span>at the youth we suffer.</span>
<span>forget, confess,</span>
<span>whether you really felt something.</span></p><p><span>i cant believe that in some years</span>
<span>you will only be a memory of my childhood,</span>
<span>of my useless attempts</span>
<span>of being who i am not</span></p><p><strong><span>a love that is not corresponded,</span></strong>
<span>is what i made you suffer from,</span>
<span>now i pay the price,</span>
<span>with your own sufferment.</span></p><p><span>i break, i decay, i decompose and i break down,</span>
<span>many things that i promised,</span>
<span>many things that wont come true,</span>
<span>many false hopes that i gave you</span></p><p><span>only for my future to repeat these errors,</span>
<span>for my person to hate themselves,</span>
<span>for my body to unappreciate itself,</span>
<span>for my soul to rebel</span></p><p><strong><span>a remedy for a broken heart,</span></strong>
<span>i would wish to give you so that you can ban me from it,</span>
<span>and the only solution,</span>
<span>is to break mine</span></p>
