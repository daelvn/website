# feel

Have you ever felt different?
Have you ever felt broken?
Have you ever felt like you did not belong?
But on a whole new level.

It was not just my group of friends,
or my school,
or my family,
or my town,
or other people.

It was everyone,
it was the world around me.

Perhaps it was just me.
Perhaps I was meant for something else.
Perhaps I never belonged to this world at all.

I AM BROKEN. I AM BROKEN. I AM BROKEN. I AM BROKEN. I AM BROKEN. I AM BROKEN. I AM BROKEN. I AM BROKEN. I AM BROKEN. I AM BROKEN. I AM BROKEN. I AM BROKEN. I AM BROKEN. I AM BROKEN. I AM BROKEN.
