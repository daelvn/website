<h1><a name="goodbye" class="md-header-anchor"></a><span>goodbye</span></h1><p><span>rain, rain and more rain.</span>
<span>what would it be of my body,</span>
<span>buried in a mossy tombstone,</span>
<span>without water that washes my sin.</span></p><p><span>and my phantom would wander</span>
<span>that eternal and autumnal forest,</span>
<span>even if it&#39;s only once again,</span>
<span>from the beginning to the end.</span></p><p><span>i would wake from my grave</span>
<span>to walk for the last time</span>
<span>to the stream of the freshest water</span>
<span>that my hands had ever touched.</span></p><p><span>it leads to a small lake</span>
<span>surrounded by no more than spruce and stone,</span>
<span>with a row boat,</span>
<span>to end up as far as possible.</span></p><p><span>i guide myself through the mist</span>
<span>using the voices that have always called me.</span>
<span>if i don&#39;t see you anymore in earth</span>
<span>i hope that this is my destiny.</span></p><p><span>because there&#39;s no place more silent,</span>
<span>no fresher air,</span>
<span>no calmer soul</span>
<span>than mine in this place.</span></p><p><span>back to the forest, i take the path.</span>
<span>i know where it will take me</span>
<span>but i walk it as if</span>
<span>i had never stepped on it before.</span></p><p><span>and my already ethereal body</span>
<span>would present itself there,</span>
<span>in front of the cabin</span>
<span>that appears in all of my dreams.</span></p><p><span>preserved wood with a</span>
<span>small porch, it is enough.</span>
<span>i sit in the rocker bench</span>
<span>singing songs in my mind.</span></p><p><span>it&#39;s a homely cabin, it is small,</span>
<span>but it has all i need:</span>
<span>to be alone and, for the last time,</span>
<span>in peace with my rested soul.</span></p><p><span>my eyes would see for the last time</span>
<span>this place destined for me.</span>
<span>oh, how will i miss the views</span>
<span>to my small garden.</span></p><p><span>and through one of the windows</span>
<span>i can see giant mountains</span>
<span>covered in trees and mist</span>
<span>of my same transparency.</span></p><p><span>i might have left behind my body</span>
<span>but i know the raindrops will still calm my soul,</span>
<span>even if it&#39;s just one,</span>
<span>just one last time.</span></p><p><span>and i would sleep in that bed</span>
<span>surrounded by you, listening to your voice</span>
<span>to leave you forever,</span>
<span>even if it&#39;s not what i promised.</span></p><p><span>i would gaze at everything amazed,</span>
<span>the beauty of nature,</span>
<span>and my soul in its purest state.</span>
<span>i leave you behind, my dear.</span></p><p><span>and with my last breath i go back to my eternal resting place.</span>
<span>goodbye, it was a pleasure to meet you.</span></p><h3><a name="related-thoughts" class="md-header-anchor"></a><span>related thoughts</span></h3><h4><a name="never-be-seen-again" class="md-header-anchor"></a><span>never be seen again</span></h4><p><span>:: i want that the last thing people know of me ::</span>

<span>:: and perhaps if our planet disappears ::</span>
<span>:: i trust that i will be part of another star ::</span>
<span>:: and if there&#39;s life on another planet and someone looks at the constellation that my star forms ::</span>
<span>:: that person will have my power and will know i&#39;m with them ::</span>
<span>:: i don&#39;t want to leave a trace before i die when i can leave a trace in the form of pure light ::</span>
<span>::[how light carries on endlessly, even after death - saturn - sleeping at last]::</span></p><h4><a name="promise" class="md-header-anchor"></a><span>promise</span></h4><p><span>:: during all my childhood but now too ::</span>
<span>:: i promised the third, my plushes, this constant voice that guards me ::</span>
<span>:: that i would never leave them, that no matter what i would be with them ::</span>
<span>:: i&#39;m scared that if i take meds i will stop hearing them ::</span>

<span>:: my phantom will be out of its grave and sleep in a bed with them like i have done all my life ::</span>
<span>:: but that would be the last time, and the best of them all ::</span>
<span>:: when my soul steps on my resting place for the last time, i will disappear forever ::</span>
<span>:: i will fuse with nature, that is what i desire ::</span>
<span>:: i don&#39;t care about going to a prestigious university anymore ::</span>
<span>:: i don&#39;t care that the world won&#39;t remember my name ::</span>
