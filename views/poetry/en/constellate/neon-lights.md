# neon lights

the febrile neon lights chase me
suffocate me in your eyes
let them shine in the rain
cover me in your mind
be the natural light in the artifice

fall your thunder over my soul
be my god and give me wings
let me reach you in the peak of the possible

rain your truth over my lie
be my judge and revoke my sense
make me see i dont own you

the febrile neon lights chase me
wash me in your word, let it reach me
tell me you can love me but dont fulfill it
