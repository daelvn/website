# to the childhood

Golden stars in a violet sky,
Victorian dressing tables filled with precious jewelry,
the distant sound of a music box
that moves my hand writing this poem.

A lot of wooden toys in some house in my town,
it has a chimney and in the sofa he leaves my gifts,
Santa Claus, when he visits me
in my eternal Christmas and youth.

And all the places are full of lights and trees
with ornaments in garnet and gold, a lot of rag dolls,
hand-made by little elves
who work for me to be happy.

The sky is painted with watercolor, navy
blues and purples, stars that shine
more than ever in the city
that gazes at them.

And in my bed there are freshly laundered sheets
in green and decorated with trains
that carry me to my dreams every night
and take me back to remember.

And all my plushes are there, all of them
have their name and heart, all of them are with me
and sing me a lullaby so
that tomorrow the sun will rise.

But I do not get sleepy
so I talk to them and they tell me
ll of their adventures and all of their travels
and I smile thoughtfully while they talk to me.

And the chimney, its warm fire illuminates
the furniture that smells like wood from
my bed. And the angels with immense wings
tuck me in my bed and sing another lullaby.

And I know all of the songs and I
whisper them while they sing.
And my eyelids close slowly until
I wake up and it is a new day.

And there are still wooden toys,
and interesting books, and stories to get lost in,
and many music boxes that tell me stories,
while I spend the afternoon in my pajamas.
