<h1><a name="corrupted-angels" class="md-header-anchor"></a><span>corrupted angels</span></h1><p><span>Your wings are broken, angel,</span>
<span>why are you here?</span>
<span>Open your eyes and answer me,</span>
<span>why does your heart beat again?</span></p><p><span>Your golden hair now is just ashes.</span>
<span>Oh, angel, return with your kind,</span>
<span>return if you can because</span>
<span>I can already hear the drums.</span></p><p><span>Here the breeze doesn&#39;t run,</span>
<span>the one you&#39;re so used to.</span>
<span>Oh, angel, breathe deeper,</span>
<span>if your burden allows you to.</span></p><p><span>You are so weak, angel,</span>
<span>your chanting is barely heard.</span>
<span>Oh, angel, scream and</span>
<span>liberate yourself from your new chains.</span></p><p><span>Didn&#39;t your wings use to fly?</span>
<span>Didn&#39;t you protect me so many nights?</span>
<span>How deep in lava are you right now?</span>
<span>Float, levitate, make yourself a way to the new.</span></p><p><span>Your eyes are now black, angel.</span>
<span>Does your soul not rest now?</span>
<span>Look around you, praise</span>
<span>your new jail for your soul.</span></p><p><span>Your voice is now hoarse.</span>
<span>Oh, angel, save yourself from the dark,</span>
<span>save yourself if you can because</span>
<span>you don&#39;t follow your own steps now.</span></p><p><span>You hardly breathe</span>
<span>and now your halo is dark.</span>
<span>You yell so loud, angel</span>
<span>what an incredible ability!</span></p><p><span>Run but the chains will imprison you.</span>
<span>Run away but the arrows will catch you.</span>
<span>Scream but the shadows will smother you.</span>
<span>I invite you to try, angel.</span></p><p><span>Don&#39;t sleep, my angel,</span>
<span>don&#39;t let them catch you sleeping.</span>
<span>It is then when they attack,</span>
<span>the riders of the intenal apocalypse.</span></p><p><span>I am sure you are very tired, angel.</span>
<span>Here, have a cup of my blood.</span>
<span>Didn&#39;t you use to take it away from me</span>
<span>and now you are rejecting it?</span></p><p><span>Admit it, you are dead, and</span>
<span>in your heart only madness remains.</span>
<span>Where does your God lie now?</span>
<span>Was not his power the greatest?</span></p><p><span>But worry not,</span>
<span>you can already give me your trumpet.</span>
<span>You will stop tormenting me,</span>
<span>you will never reign my dreams anymore.</span></p><p><span>You made me impure and</span>
<span>that is what you will become, angel.</span>
<span>Louder, scream louder!</span>
<span>Make yours my contained fury!</span></p><p><span>It consumes you, it is superior,</span>
<span>isn&#39;t it so, my angel?</span>
<span>Your skin isn&#39;t so smooth,</span>
<span>nor your hair is so perfect.</span></p><p><span>Nothing but your heart remains</span>
<span>and even then, corrupt, it won&#39;t be removed.</span>
<span>You will pay for the sins</span>
<span>you were so eager to fight against.</span></p><p><span>Suffer, suffer in front of me</span>
<span>like I did in front of you.</span>
<span>I will look in the distance</span>
<span>like you did for me.</span></p><p><span>I will wipe your tears</span>
<span>but I won&#39;t give up on you.</span>
<span>You promised me salvation,</span>
<span>but you only gave me sin.</span></p><p><span>Now it is I who wins,</span>
<span>in this cold, cold and empty room.</span>
<span>God bless your soul,</span>
<span>he has not blessed mine.</span></p><p><span>I will break your holy heart</span>
<span>until it bleeds, it bleeds and dies.</span>
<span>My hero, my legend,</span>
<span>my fall, my death.</span></p><p><span>Look at yourself, you are broken, angel,</span>
<span>and broken toys are not</span>
<span>liked by anybody.</span>
<span>You are nothing but trash now.</span></p><p><span>Look at yourself, you are crazy, angel,</span>
<span>you do not know what you are saying,</span>
<span>but I know very well how much you curse me,</span>
<span>or didn&#39;t you see my luck?</span></p><p><span>You died in my hands,</span>
<span>I do npt need you anymore,</span>
<span>now I am the owner of my destine,</span>
<span>now you will not manipulate us anmore.</span></p><p><span>You are gushing sweat, crying blood,</span>
<span>you are miserable and you are agonizing.</span>
<span>That is how you used to see me</span>
<span>but you never did anything about it.</span></p><p><span>Your cries are worhtless to me now,</span>
<span>you only speak trash and tell deceits.</span>
<span>My only angel is me,</span>
<span>you last-longing impostor.</span></p><p><span>Look how the destroyed souls</span>
<span>of your friends are celebrating.</span>
<span>Grey bodies in yellowish linen</span>
<span>who sing and dance in circles.</span></p><p><span>Wouldn&#39;t you like to join them?</span>
<span>It is a shame, for you will stay</span>
<span>with me and only with me.</span>
<span>That&#39;s what you said in my childhood, traitor.</span></p><p><span>Does not the melody of</span>
<span>all of us kids who ever sang</span>
<span>to you stay in your mind?</span>
<span>Does it not ashame you?</span></p><p><span>Rot, angel, rot</span>
<span>in my soul! You will not escape.</span>
<span>You will not hurt anyone</span>
<span>else ever again.</span></p><p><span>Your soul is sinking,</span>
<span>and your heart barely pumps.</span>
<span>Forever together, angel,</span>
<span>forever together.</span></p><p><span>Here, use your lyre,</span>
<span>let me hear your voice.</span>
<span>Sing to me one of these lullabies</span>
<span>to calm the pain.</span></p><p><span>Dead as you are sacred,</span>
<span>agonizing as your God is high.</span>
<span>Be born, come out of your chrysalis,</span>
<span>fly, little angel, fly.</span></p><p><span>Do you hear the roaring? It is them.</span>
<span>They devoured my soul and</span>
<span>they will not hesitate to come.</span>
<span>You will feel them.</span></p><p><span>They will chew on you</span>
<span>until their teeth are numb.</span>
<span>They will drink your poison</span>
<span>as much as you perish.</span></p><p><span>I am broken too.</span>
<span>Look at me, stare at me.</span>
<span>Deign to look at my eyes,</span>
<span>your morbid creation.</span></p><p><span>I will drag you, I will drag you</span>
<span>until your face is no</span>
<span>different from mine.</span>
<span>You will not last, you will not last.</span></p><p><span>Your chains are open, angel,</span>
<span>let us see how do you walk,</span>
<span>let us see how do you take vengeance</span>
<span>if you do not obey me already.</span></p><p><span>Sing to me in your celestial language,</span>
<span>breathe your divine air.</span>
<span>Purify your wounds,</span>
<span>are you not free now?</span></p><p><span>Look at me! I am your creation!</span>
<span>I am your demon! You made me like this!</span>
<span>Touch my horns! Do not feel pity!</span>
<span>Oh, my poor angel, poor you.</span></p><p><span>Get on your knees and pray to me,</span>
<span>just as I did to you.</span>
<span>Realize how useless</span>
<span>were your healing prayers.</span></p><p><span>Poison, they were poison</span>
<span>that corrupted my soul</span>
<span>and it will now corrupt</span>
<span>your divine and sacred temple.</span></p><p><span>Oh my angel, my hero,</span>
<span>pardon my sins as you</span>
<span>also pardoned the</span>
<span>sinners who killed me.</span></p><p><span>You are nothing but garbage,</span>
<span>you are nothing but dust.</span>
<span>Cough. Spit. Disappear.</span>
<span>Die and never come again.</span></p>
