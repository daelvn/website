# temple

many times a temple has trembled
when a god wreaks havoc on it.
a shrine so beautiful,
a chapel so pure.

and when you go inside
you can't help but see the marks
that the building is in ruins
yearning for somebody to rebuild it.

oh, who has ever seen an angel
walk into a temple unarmed
because for the first time
they loved human creation?

and when the doors open
they creak and crumble.
and when i step inside
the other angels cry.

they beg for their life,
they want to save the temple,
but a deity will not always listen
no matter how faithful we are.

and i run my hands
through the cracks in the stone,
a shrine in white and gold
calls for me.

and i run through the pillars
set in polished marble
shining as you are,
light as you are beautiful.

and when i kneel in the shrine
i can hear the god,
calling my name,
calling my name.

this temple is not my home
for home is not a place i feel safe in,
in home i am vulnerable,
i am weak.

in a temple i am able to pray
and you will protect me
as much as i do,
veneration is truly safe.

and i remember asking you
"why do you do this to your own?
why must you hurt this way?"
oh, how na√Øve of me.

you break your own temple
because you feel trapped in it
it might be beautiful
but it does not have your beauty.

because when i touch the gold
in the sculpted shine,
and i hear your voice
resonate in my mind.

i finally comprehend,
the deity has more to them
than in here i see.
oh how sad it becomes.

but if i could extend my wings,
if i could surround it with them,
if i could shine a light
powerful with my halo.

i would vow to rebuild,
i would vow to venerate,
i would vow to stay the nights,
taking care of it.

for the temple is your body
and the deity your mind.
the angels your wishes
and the demons your fears.

for the cracks are your scars
and the marble your skin,
the gold your beauty
and the stone your will.

**i will make you into the greatest deity this world has seen.**
**the prettiest temple you've become to me.**
