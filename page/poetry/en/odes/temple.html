<h1><a name="temple" class="md-header-anchor"></a><span>temple</span></h1><p><span>many times a temple has trembled</span>
<span>when a god wreaks havoc on it.</span>
<span>a shrine so beautiful,</span>
<span>a chapel so pure.</span></p><p><span>and when you go inside</span>
<span>you can&#39;t help but see the marks</span>
<span>that the building is in ruins</span>
<span>yearning for somebody to rebuild it.</span></p><p><span>oh, who has ever seen an angel</span>
<span>walk into a temple unarmed</span>
<span>because for the first time</span>
<span>they loved human creation?</span></p><p><span>and when the doors open</span>
<span>they creak and crumble.</span>
<span>and when i step inside</span>
<span>the other angels cry.</span></p><p><span>they beg for their life,</span>
<span>they want to save the temple,</span>
<span>but a deity will not always listen</span>
<span>no matter how faithful we are.</span></p><p><span>and i run my hands</span>
<span>through the cracks in the stone,</span>
<span>a shrine in white and gold</span>
<span>calls for me.</span></p><p><span>and i run through the pillars</span>
<span>set in polished marble</span>
<span>shining as you are,</span>
<span>light as you are beautiful.</span></p><p><span>and when i kneel in the shrine</span>
<span>i can hear the god,</span>
<span>calling my name,</span>
<span>calling my name.</span></p><p><span>this temple is not my home</span>
<span>for home is not a place i feel safe in,</span>
<span>in home i am vulnerable,</span>
<span>i am weak.</span></p><p><span>in a temple i am able to pray</span>
<span>and you will protect me</span>
<span>as much as i do,</span>
<span>veneration is truly safe.</span></p><p><span>and i remember asking you</span>
<span>&quot;why do you do this to your own?</span>
<span>why must you hurt this way?&quot;</span>
<span>oh, how na√Øve of me.</span></p><p><span>you break your own temple</span>
<span>because you feel trapped in it</span>
<span>it might be beautiful</span>
<span>but it does not have your beauty.</span></p><p><span>because when i touch the gold</span>
<span>in the sculpted shine,</span>
<span>and i hear your voice</span>
<span>resonate in my mind.</span></p><p><span>i finally comprehend,</span>
<span>the deity has more to them</span>
<span>than in here i see.</span>
<span>oh how sad it becomes.</span></p><p><span>but if i could extend my wings,</span>
<span>if i could surround it with them,</span>
<span>if i could shine a light</span>
<span>powerful with my halo.</span></p><p><span>i would vow to rebuild,</span>
<span>i would vow to venerate,</span>
<span>i would vow to stay the nights,</span>
<span>taking care of it.</span></p><p><span>for the temple is your body</span>
<span>and the deity your mind.</span>
<span>the angels your wishes</span>
<span>and the demons your fears.</span></p><p><span>for the cracks are your scars</span>
<span>and the marble your skin,</span>
<span>the gold your beauty</span>
<span>and the stone your will.</span></p><p><strong><span>i will make you into the greatest deity this world has seen.</span></strong>
<strong><span>the prettiest temple you&#39;ve become to me.</span></strong></p>
