<h1>go back</h1>
<p>sometimes i wonder whether i
could repeat it all again,
fix everything, be better,
help others, help myself.</p>
<p>but then i realize that,
perhaps it was fine like that,
perhaps i really did what i could,
it ended like it had to end.</p>
<p>people don&#39;t acknowledge during their lives
that they&#39;re really doing the best they can,
with the tools that they have.
it&#39;s okay if it couldn&#39;t have been more.</p>
<p>you&#39;re doing okay, i promise.
it&#39;s fine like that.
you did what you could.</p>
<p><strong>to whoever&#39;s reading this,</strong>
<strong>i&#39;m with you, okay?</strong></p>
