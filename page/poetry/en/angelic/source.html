<h1><a name="source" class="md-header-anchor"></a><span>source</span></h1><p><span>I am sitting on a throne of white marble,</span>
<span>ornamented with shining gold.</span>
<span>Every corner of the memory is bathed</span>
<span>in a clear, powerful white light that engulfs</span>
<span>everything to the point that it is almost blinding.</span></p><p><span>But I have been here before.</span></p><p><span>Beside me, a torch lit on fire,</span>
<span>on my other side, a golden cup.</span>
<span>Right in front of me, descending stairs</span>
<span>that lead me to a point where my sight does not reach,</span>
<span>deep into the clouds down below.</span></p><p><span>Rays of sunlight touch my skin and make it glitter,</span>
<span>and the air as fresh as it has ever been.</span>
<span>Heaven is lonely when you have nobody to share it with.</span>
<span>The distant sound of choirs and trumpets in perfect</span>
<span>harmony but I am all above.</span></p><p><span>I can stand up and extend my wings, and although</span>
<span>one of my shoulders is uncovered, my halo can</span>
<span>give me the warmth I need to live so high up.</span>
<span>My wings are as white as the clouds below me,</span>
<span>pure and filled with resistant feathers.</span></p><p><span>I begin to go down the stairs as it calls me,</span>
<span>and I just dissipate into the clouds.</span></p><p><span>Wherever it is,</span>
<span>whoever it is,</span>
<span>whenever it is.</span></p><p><span>I know I have been there.</span></p><p><span>I know I must be there.</span></p><p><span>HEAVEN CALLS ME. HEAVEN CALLS ME. HEAVEN CALLS ME. HEAVEN CALLS ME.
