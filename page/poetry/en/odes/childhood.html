<h1><a name="to-the-childhood" class="md-header-anchor"></a><span>to the childhood</span></h1><p><span>Golden stars in a violet sky,</span>
<span>Victorian dressing tables filled with precious jewelry,</span>
<span>the distant sound of a music box</span>
<span>that moves my hand writing this poem.</span></p><p><span>A lot of wooden toys in some house in my town,</span>
<span>it has a chimney and in the sofa he leaves my gifts,</span>
<span>Santa Claus, when he visits me</span>
<span>in my eternal Christmas and youth.</span></p><p><span>And all the places are full of lights and trees</span>
<span>with ornaments in garnet and gold, a lot of rag dolls,</span>
<span>hand-made by little elves</span>
<span>who work for me to be happy.</span></p><p><span>The sky is painted with watercolor, navy</span>
<span>blues and purples, stars that shine</span>
<span>more than ever in the city</span>
<span>that gazes at them.</span></p><p><span>And in my bed there are freshly laundered sheets</span>
<span>in green and decorated with trains</span>
<span>that carry me to my dreams every night</span>
<span>and take me back to remember.</span></p><p><span>And all my plushes are there, all of them</span>
<span>have their name and heart, all of them are with me</span>
<span>and sing me a lullaby so</span>
<span>that tomorrow the sun will rise.</span></p><p><span>But I do not get sleepy</span>
<span>so I talk to them and they tell me</span>
<span>ll of their adventures and all of their travels</span>
<span>and I smile thoughtfully while they talk to me.</span></p><p><span>And the chimney, its warm fire illuminates</span>
<span>the furniture that smells like wood from</span>
<span>my bed. And the angels with immense wings</span>
<span>tuck me in my bed and sing another lullaby.</span></p><p><span>And I know all of the songs and I</span>
<span>whisper them while they sing.</span>
<span>And my eyelids close slowly until</span>
<span>I wake up and it is a new day.</span></p><p><span>And there are still wooden toys,</span>
<span>and interesting books, and stories to get lost in,</span>
<span>and many music boxes that tell me stories,</span>
<span>while I spend the afternoon in my pajamas.</span></p>
