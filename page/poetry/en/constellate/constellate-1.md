# constellate pt. I

a night was worth ten
you pulled me close and left me hanging
wanted more but you were gone

nothing in return and i watched the look in your eyes
while i put my eyes on you
but yours shined for another star

i didnt realize and soon i fell
you caught me in your net and i cant get out
but you have no part for me

im sorry if i smothered you
sometimes i wish
iâ€™d never been born
