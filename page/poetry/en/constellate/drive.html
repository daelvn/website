<h1><a name="drive" class="md-header-anchor"></a><span>drive</span></h1><p><span>Driving away,</span>
<span>none to little faith.</span>
<span>Stars that will light my face,</span>
<span>blades that will cry my death.</span></p><p><span>I feel alone,</span>
<span>I&#39;m all alone...</span></p><p><span>Friends I go out with.</span>
<span>Confidence, it&#39;s all a myth.</span></p><p><span>I feel my heart.</span>
<span>Can you feel it now?</span></p><p><span>One more mile, one more mile</span>
<span>and I&#39;ll be out.</span>
<span>Let&#39;s not be loud.</span></p><p><span>One more mile, one more mile</span>
<span>to see the day,</span>
<span>or to fade away.</span></p><p><span>Things to be undone,</span>
<span>just a mile more.</span></p><p><span>Make up your mind.</span>
<span>Is this my heart?</span></p><p><span>Feelings that can&#39;t be parsed,</span>
<span>a ground that&#39;s so coarse.</span></p><p><span>I&#39;ve lost my head,</span>
<span>a war was led.</span></p><p><span>Nothing feels real,</span>
<span>I&#39;m the one he wants to kill.</span></p><p><span>I pour my thoughts,</span>
<span>can you see it now?</span></p><p><span>One more mile, one more mile</span>
<span>and I&#39;ll be out.</span>
<span>Let&#39;s not be loud.</span></p><p><span>One more mile, one more mile</span>
<span>to see the day,</span>
<span>or to fade away.</span></p><p><span>A heart that skips a beat,</span>
<span>a brain that thinks of me.</span></p><p><span>It&#39;s all I need,</span>
<span>just someone here.</span></p><p><span>// I see the exit //</span>
<span>// I drive out //</span>
<span>// Not my place //</span>
<span>// Not my heart //</span>
<span>// They tore it apart //</span>
<span>// They tore me apart //</span></p><p><span>One more mile, one more mile</span>
<span>and I&#39;ll be out.</span>
<span>Let&#39;s not be loud.</span></p><p><span>One more mile, one more mile</span>
<span>to see the day,</span>
<span>or to fade away.</span></p>
