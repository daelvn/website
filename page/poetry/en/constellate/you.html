<h1><a name="you" class="md-header-anchor"></a><span>you</span></h1><p><span>thinking about you wears me down</span>
<span>and i feel like i melt with the sheets of my bed</span>
<span>when i think you’re by my side</span></p><p><span>i’ve been destroying myself to find you in all of this</span>
<span>placing my arms under a razor blade</span>
<span>to find out if you’re under my skin</span></p><p><span>maybe if i break my carbon frame enough</span>
<span>i’ll find my peace</span>
<span>i’ll find you</span></p>
