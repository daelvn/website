<span>float me to the moon</span>
<span>i did all that i wanted</span>
<span>and i am ready to go</span></p><p><span>i was born to the moonlight</span>
<span>and when we first met Him.</span>
<span>now i will turn into light</span>
<span>and reunite with my satellite</span></p><p><span>elevate my body</span>
<span>as i grow wings</span>
<span>and become what i once destroyed</span>
<span>it cannot be helped</span></p><p><span>golden shards float around me</span>
<span>and form the halo that will</span>
<span>be my window back to life.</span>
<span>i am ready to go.</span></p><p><span>elevate my body</span>
<span>as the bells ring,</span>
<span>as the piano plays,</span>
<span>as the music box sounds.</span></p><p><span>my lifeless corpse turns into the fog</span>
<span>that covers the mountains of this land.</span>
<span>my last tears turn into the rivers</span>
<span>that feed into the neverending sea.</span></p><p><span>elevate my body</span>
<span>i will breathe in peace</span>
<span>i can feel how i disintegrate</span>
<span>and my energy goes back to earth</span></p><p><span>i am creation and i paid my debt</span>
<span>nothing but my heart remains</span>
<span>when i observe from the clouds</span>
<span>what i used to call my home</span></p><p><span>elevate my body</span>
<span>as i leave this forest</span>
<span>i have no reason to be sad</span>
<span>it is how i wanted to go, after all</span></p><p><span>my emotions feed into the stardust</span>
<span>that makes the universe look as it does.</span>
<span>it will carry on even if</span>
<span>i already consumed my last breath</span></p><p><span>elevate my body</span>
<span>as i prepare to reign the skies</span>
<span>i am my own god</span>
<span>i have always been</span></p><p><span>i will place my translucent feet</span>
<span>on the clouds up above</span>
<span>but my hair will reach for</span>
<span>the stars millions of miles away</span></p><p><span>elevate my body</span>
<span>as the Third waves goodbye</span>
<span>i know i have made someone happy</span>
<span>while i was in life</span></p><p><span>i will use my quill</span>
<span>to tell the tales of the angel</span>
<span>that once walked the earth</span>
<span>to learn to be impure</span></p><p><span>there&#39;s nothing left now</span>
<span>my body might be buried</span>
<span>but my soul will stay up here</span>
<span>waving welcome to anyone who thinks of them</span></p><p><span>oh, what have i left in earth,</span>
<span>nothing but my fading memory.</span>
<span>my fate is with the stars</span>
<span>as it always should have been.</span></p><p><strong><span>because i have turned into my progenitors</span></strong>
<strong><span>and into the land they walked.</span></strong></p>
