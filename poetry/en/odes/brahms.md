# to the brahms' lullaby

Sing to the night,
sing to the moon,
be the new angel
that guards my cradle.

I wish I had counted
all the dreams
that you guided me through
when we were younger.

Your melody continued
to resonate in my head,
when I had to cry
at night, silently.

But one day you got lost
and I couldn't find you again.
You were spinning in my head
and one day I lost track.

You were art so I left,
and worldwide I searched for you.
Where are you, my angel?
Even to Italy I will go.

And when I found you
I broke in tears,
I hugged you and told you
that in my pocket you would be safe.

Now when I listen
and I do it carefully,
I still hear your voice,
glorious in my mind.

**But you are a soul**
**and in my head you're present.**

> when i was young, i had a bunny stuffed plush. you could pull it and it would play a lullaby until i fell asleep. the music box was inside the head, and the bunny hung from my shelf so i could pull it before going to sleep. as i grew up, it had to be put away, and when i tried to get it back from the attic, it was filled with insect eggs. after me crying a lot, we had to throw it away. many years later, i had a school trip to Florence, Italy, and i entered a gift shop next to Il Duomo. there were some music boxes, labelled, and i played them one by one… until the last one… i played the first seconds of it, only to be overwhelmed with emotion and memories. i immediately bought the music box and started crying in that shop. i finally found it again, the nameless lullaby. Brahms' lullaby.
