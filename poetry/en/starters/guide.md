# guide

Walk under the starry
night and ask him:
What is above you
if you do not know it?

Breathe the fresh and
humid air of the forest.
Who guides your steps
towards the unfortunate landing?

Touch their ghost and
feel the shivers.
Who guides your heart,
powerful so silently?

Homing pigeon,
do not listen to the message.
Do you not know how much it hurts
to die in this landscape?

Weapon of two,
one-sided dagger.
Pick it with your hands
and cover the blood with thread.

They say there are two
but you only see one.
The other for you
is made of clothes and rags.

**Run, go and tell them before it is too late,**
**that I guide my steps and they guide my heart.**
