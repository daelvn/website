<h1><a name="humanity" class="md-header-anchor"></a><span>humanity</span></h1><p><span>Humanity is a convention</span>
<span>none of us agreed to.</span>
<span>Look at my face and tell me</span>
<span>whether I am some kind of defaced monster.</span></p><p><span>Stare at my lifeless gaze and tell me</span>
<span>what is inside of me,</span>
<span>if there is,</span>
<span>and if there is, whether you call it human.</span></p><p><span>What is being human but</span>
<span>a set of rules,</span>
<span>of prejudices, of conventions</span>
<span>that they say we have to follow?</span></p><p><span>What does it mean to be a person?</span>
<span>Who says so?</span>
<span>How much do they reign over my soul</span>
<span>to tell me so?</span></p><p><span>It is a big deceit,</span>
<span>a deception,</span>
<span>they only dehumanize</span>
<span>when they feel they have to.</span></p><p><span>But they all were human,</span>
<span>the murderers and the genocidal,</span>
<span>and at the same time none of us is,</span>
<span>only because they say so.</span></p><p><span>Then I am not human,</span>
<span>I refuse, I will not bow down,</span>
<span>anything but that.</span>
<span>You won&#39;t hear me say I&#39;m human.</span></p><p><span>I say I have wings</span>
<span>but that you can&#39;t see them.</span>
<span>I say I have fangs</span>
<span>but that I won&#39;t bite you.</span></p><p><span>Feel my breeze,</span>
<span>feel the power</span>
<span>of having the domain of oneself</span>
<span>and not get lost.</span></p><p><strong><span>Because I am like a wolf to people</span></strong>
<strong><span>and people are like wolves to me.</span></strong></p>
