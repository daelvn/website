# goodbye

rain, rain and more rain.
what would it be of my body,
buried in a mossy tombstone,
without water that washes my sin.

and my phantom would wander
that eternal and autumnal forest,
even if it's only once again,
from the beginning to the end.

i would wake from my grave
to walk for the last time
to the stream of the freshest water
that my hands had ever touched.

it leads to a small lake
surrounded by no more than spruce and stone,
with a row boat,
to end up as far as possible.

i guide myself through the mist
using the voices that have always called me.
if i don't see you anymore in earth
i hope that this is my destiny.

because there's no place more silent,
no fresher air,
no calmer soul
than mine in this place.

back to the forest, i take the path.
i know where it will take me
but i walk it as if
i had never stepped on it before.

and my already ethereal body
would present itself there,
in front of the cabin
that appears in all of my dreams.

preserved wood with a
small porch, it is enough.
i sit in the rocker bench
singing songs in my mind.

it's a homely cabin, it is small,
but it has all i need:
to be alone and, for the last time,
in peace with my rested soul.

my eyes would see for the last time
this place destined for me.
oh, how will i miss the views
to my small garden.

and through one of the windows
i can see giant mountains
covered in trees and mist
of my same transparency.

i might have left behind my body
but i know the raindrops will still calm my soul,
even if it's just one,
just one last time.

and i would sleep in that bed
surrounded by you, listening to your voice
to leave you forever,
even if it's not what i promised.

i would gaze at everything amazed,
the beauty of nature,
and my soul in its purest state.
i leave you behind, my dear.

and with my last breath i go back to my eternal resting place.
goodbye, it was a pleasure to meet you.
