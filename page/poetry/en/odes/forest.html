<h1><a name="to-the-forest" class="md-header-anchor"></a><span>to the forest</span></h1><p><span>i found a log</span>
<span>between all the trees.</span>
<span>one that&#39;s broken, fallen</span>
<span>so i could sit.</span></p><p><span>the sun is setting where i am,</span>
<span>but i don&#39;t know where that is.</span>
<span>time has passed,</span>
<span>i don&#39;t know what i&#39;ll do today.</span></p><p><span>because when i look around,</span>
<span>and i see how far i&#39;ve gotten,</span>
<span>i don&#39;t believe i&#39;m</span>
<span>sitting on this tree.</span></p><p><span>i don&#39;t even know the leaves</span>
<span>falling in the autumn.</span>
<span>i only know it is the most</span>
<span>beautiful thing i&#39;ve ever seen.</span></p><p><span>because i walk through it</span>
<span>and i hear a distant melody,</span>
<span>that tells me to</span>
<span>sing it, whistle it.</span></p><p><span>because i walk through it</span>
<span>and i smell the smoke</span>
<span>of wood, so unique,</span>
<span>so full and peculiar.</span></p><p><span>here i am,</span>
<span>among several logs,</span>
<span>among angels</span>
<span>of my kind.</span></p><p><span>because i see every</span>
<span>soul that hides</span>
<span>here, in this forest,</span>
<span>and call me to fly wit them.</span></p><p><span>i&#39;ve cried so many times,</span>
<span>trapped for so many days,</span>
<span>and here i am,</span>
<span>alone in this forest.</span></p><p><span>so that now i cry of happiness,</span>
<span>i&#39;m where i wanted to be.</span>
<span>a bit of luck,</span>
<span>a bit of effort.</span></p><p><strong><span>to get lost in a forest</span></strong>
<strong><span>and not look back.</span></strong></p>
