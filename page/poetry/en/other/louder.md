# louder

louder, louder, louder.
i need enough noise to
drown all my thoughts away.
all of them.

louder, louder, louder.
i wish it were loud
enough to somehow
stop me from thinking altogether.

louder, louder, louder.
i need it to be loud enough
to stop existing,
to vanish somehow.

louder, louder, louder.
i need it to be loud enough
so i stop feeling my body,
even if just for one song.

louder, louder, louder
than the sounds i hear
when my vocal chords
twitch and talk.

louder, louder, louder,
i need it to be loud enough
so i don't even hear them,
so i don't even hear myself.

LOUDER, LOUDER, LOUDER.
I WANT TO HEAR NOTHING
BUT NOISE, BUT SPIKES,
SO MY EARS MIGHT JUST FAIL.

LOUDER, LOUDER, LOUDER.
SO THEY ARE SPEAKERS
POINTING RIGHT TO MY EARS,
SO THEY MIGHT JUST BREAK.

LOUDER, LOUDER, LOUDER.
SO GOD MAY HEAR MY NAME
WHEN I BLOW UP TO PIECES
FROM ALL OF THIS PAIN.

LOUDER, LOUDER, LOUDER.
SO THE ANGELS WHISPER
MY NAME TO EACH OTHER,
AS IF A RANCID RUMOR.

LOUDER, LOUDER, LOUDER.
SO THE EARTH MIGHT CRACK
AND I CAN FALL THROUGH
AND MELT WITH IT.

LOUDER, LOUDER, LOUDER.
SO DEMONS WILL CRY ME,
BUT THEIR TEARS WOULD VANISH,
FROM ALL THIS NOISE.

LOUDER, LOUDER, LOUDER.
SO WHEN THE NOISE STOPS,
ALL ON EARTH KNOW
WHAT HAPPENED TO ME.

LOUDER, LOUDER, LOUDER.
SO WHEN THEY CALL MY NAME,
IT WILL BECOME NOTHING.
NOTHING BUT NOISE.

BUT IT DOESN'T GET ANY MORE LOUDER.
THAN MY LUNGS CAN SCREAM.
