<h1><a name="new-blood-pt-i" class="md-header-anchor"></a><span>new blood pt. I</span></h1><p><span>I am scared when I look in the mirror</span>
<span>because I do not see myself.</span>
<span>Please, somebody tell me</span>
<span>what kind of monster have I become.</span></p><p><span>It feels like my body is not mine</span>
<span>and I do not recognize any of its</span>
<span>shapes in the dark of the night.</span>
<span>Please, somebody tell me who am I.</span></p><p><span>You are the true master</span>
<span>of the play, who controls all</span>
<span>the help that I received,</span>
<span>but your light is even darker than mine.</span></p><p><span>Why did the gods give wrath</span>
<span>to these that hate violence?</span>
<span>Do they wish to presence</span>
<span>my divine self-destruction so much?</span></p><p><span>Let me drink your blood</span>
<span>and kill me once for all.</span>
<span>Save me in your dead life.</span>
<span>New blood, new blood.</span></p><p><span>Make me of your kind,</span>
<span>and let me descend,</span>
<span>because here the stars shine so bright</span>
<span>I can&#39;t see myself.</span></p><p><span>Tell them to stop covering my eyes,</span>
<span>they only want to smother me.</span>
<span>Please, reveal it to me,</span>
<span>I must be alive for something else.</span></p><p><span>New blood, new blood,</span>
<span>I only want to live</span>
<span>so it can rain again.</span>
<span>I do put my faith in you.</span></p><p><span>They are who manipulate me,</span>
<span> they use me as a window</span>
<span> and through it they make me kneel.</span>
<span> Make it stop, make it stop.</span></p><p><span> They take control of my body</span>
<span> and with it they control me,</span>
<span> with it they hurt me.</span>
<span> Make it stop, make it stop.</span></p><p><span> Master, I know that I am dying,</span>
<span> you do not need to hide it,</span>
<span> but I only ask you to save me,</span>
<span> once again, from this situation.</span></p><p><span> Hold my hand during</span>
<span> the last breath of my life.</span>
<span> You were born with me and you will go with me:</span>
<span> the blessing of he who opens portals.</span></p><p><span> Let me drink your blood</span>
<span> so I may go with you,</span>
<span> meet with my true progenitor.</span>
<span> New blood, new blood.</span></p><p><span> </span><strong><span>I want to hurt it</span></strong>
<span> </span><strong><span>and I want it to hurt.</span></strong></p>
