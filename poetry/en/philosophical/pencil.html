<h1><a name="a-pencil" class="md-header-anchor"></a><span>a pencil</span></h1><p><span>a pencil is all you need</span>
<span>to start a revolution.</span>
<span>two people, all you need</span>
<span>to share an emotion.</span></p><p><span>the sea is not deep</span>
<span>if you only float in it.</span>
<span>nobody is going to complain</span>
<span>as long as they get well fed.</span></p><p><span>what you see nor what you hear</span>
<span>can be trusted, you don&#39;t know it.</span>
<span>there&#39;s more than one perspective,</span>
<span>and some take it to their deathbed.</span></p><p><span>if you wake up and seeing hurts,</span>
<span>don&#39;t stop seeing, improve what you see.</span>
<span>an empty hand doesn&#39;t give warmth</span>
<span>but it&#39;s better if it&#39;s more than a hundred.</span></p><p><span>i share my message,</span>
<span>i leave myself in debt,</span>
<span>to give that warmth</span>
<span>to the people surrounded by ice.</span></p><p><span>what we create is a mirror</span>
<span>that reflects reality just as</span>
<span>we see it,</span>
<span>and i have many.</span></p><p><span>if you are like me, free,</span>
<span>and don&#39;t adhere to conventional rules.</span>
<span>you understand this message as a whole.</span>
<span>you might be like me but always you.</span></p><p><span>and if the kids don&#39;t know</span>
<span>that we&#39;re there for them</span>
<span>they will have to start from scratch,</span>
<span>suffering and from the beginning.</span></p><p><strong><span>a pencil is all you need</span></strong>
