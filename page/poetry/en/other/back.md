# go back

sometimes i wonder whether i
could repeat it all again,
fix everything, be better,
help others, help myself.

but then i realize that,
perhaps it was fine like that,
perhaps i really did what i could,
it ended like it had to end.

people don't acknowledge during their lives
that they're really doing the best they can,
with the tools that they have.
it's okay if it couldn't have been more.

you're doing okay, i promise.
it's fine like that.
you did what you could.

**to whoever's reading this,**
**i'm with you, okay?**
