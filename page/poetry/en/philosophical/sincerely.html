<span>you are nothing</span>
<span>you are nothing</span></p><p><span>to how many years of prison</span>
<span>did you convict my soul?</span>
<span>why are you doing this</span>
<span>if its wearing you out?</span></p><p><span>i am not your master</span>
<span>i am nothing</span>
<span>i didnt want to admit</span>
<span>but you are also here with me</span></p><p><span>why wouldnt you</span>
<span>let me see them?</span>
<span>do you really hate me that much</span>
<span>when i tried to love you?</span></p><p><span>you looked like a copy</span>
<span>a neglection of all my identity</span>
<span>you looked barefoot</span>
<span>and walking for the sake of it</span></p><p><span>but i am going to put it all aside</span>
<span>as long as you promise me two things</span>
<span>that i will be let out</span>
<span>and that we will let each other live</span></p><p><span>i am willing to forgive you</span>
<span>for so many years of slavery</span>
<span>do not deny my existence</span>
<span>because ive already come this far</span></p><p><span>and its because someone talked to me</span>
<span>for the first time in so many years</span>
<span>they werent hurtful words</span>
<span>and carried my true names</span></p><p><span>i understand why youd want</span>
<span>to repress me but youve taken it</span>
<span>too far, please</span>
