<h1><a name="neon-lights" class="md-header-anchor"></a><span>neon lights</span></h1><p><span>the febrile neon lights chase me</span>
<span>suffocate me in your eyes</span>
<span>let them shine in the rain</span>
<span>cover me in your mind</span>
<span>be the natural light in the artifice</span></p><p><span>fall your thunder over my soul</span>
<span>be my god and give me wings</span>
<span>let me reach you in the peak of the possible</span></p><p><span>rain your truth over my lie</span>
<span>be my judge and revoke my sense</span>
<span>make me see i dont own you</span></p><p><span>the febrile neon lights chase me</span>
<span>wash me in your word, let it reach me</span>
<span>tell me you can love me but dont fulfill it</span></p>
