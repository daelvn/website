<h1><a name="constellate-pt-i" class="md-header-anchor"></a><span>constellate pt. I</span></h1><p><span>a night was worth ten</span>
<span>you pulled me close and left me hanging</span>
<span>wanted more but you were gone</span></p><p><span>nothing in return and i watched the look in your eyes</span>
<span>while i put my eyes on you</span>
<span>but yours shined for another star</span></p><p><span>i didnt realize and soon i fell</span>
<span>you caught me in your net and i cant get out</span>
<span>but you have no part for me</span></p><p><span>im sorry if i smothered you</span>
<span>sometimes i wish</span>
<span>iâ€™d never been born</span></p>
