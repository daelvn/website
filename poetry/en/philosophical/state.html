<h1><a name="new-state-of-mind" class="md-header-anchor"></a><span>new state of mind</span></h1><p><span>i don&#39;t know where i find myself in</span>
<span>and all the light that comes</span>
<span>into my room is that of</span>
<span>a streetlight and my phone</span></p><p><span>small drops of rain reflect</span>
<span>on the windows as i look out</span>
<span>and i know i mention it too often</span>
<span>but there is an aesthetic to this place</span></p><p><span>it is enticing, bewitching, enchanting</span>
<span>there is something about it that begs me</span>
<span>it begs me to stay and wander aimlessly</span>
<span>into the forests it contains</span></p><p><span>i could use a walk, if only i wanted</span>
<span>because i am not sure whether i want</span>
<span>to give up the warmth of my room</span>
<span>for only a few drops of rain</span></p><p><span>this is not the same, it just isn&#39;t</span>
<span>and memories prior to my arrival</span>
<span>just feel like a fever dream to me.</span>
<span>still not sure if i made it all up.</span></p><p><span>i just know i am where i wanted to be</span>
<span>i just know, i&#39;ve found it</span>
<span>if i ever fall to sleep eternally</span>
<span>i know it has to be here</span></p><p><strong><span>who knows if i have already</span></strong>
<strong><span>walked past my resting place?</span></strong></p>
