# [interlude]

i'm feeling lost
i woke up in a place different
to my home
i just want to know where am i

where are my wings
i can't fly without them
where are my fangs
i can't bite without them

it hurts
when parts of your body are missing
it hurts
to feel like you're not complete

why does my heart beat
i used to be inmortal, eternal
why am i human
i used to be better than this
