# new state of mind

i don't know where i find myself in
and all the light that comes
into my room is that of
a streetlight and my phone

small drops of rain reflect
on the windows as i look out
and i know i mention it too often
but there is an aesthetic to this place

it is enticing, bewitching, enchanting
there is something about it that begs me
it begs me to stay and wander aimlessly
into the forests it contains

i could use a walk, if only i wanted
because i am not sure whether i want
to give up the warmth of my room
for only a few drops of rain

this is not the same, it just isn't
and memories prior to my arrival
just feel like a fever dream to me.
still not sure if i made it all up.

i just know i am where i wanted to be
i just know, i've found it
if i ever fall to sleep eternally
i know it has to be here

**who knows if i have already**
**walked past my resting place?**
