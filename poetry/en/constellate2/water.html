<span>as you stayed in your mind.</span></p><p><span>i got to sing the song that i&#39;d written</span>
<span>but you weren&#39;t there to hear it.</span>
<span>i got to cry the tears that i&#39;d save</span>
<span>but you weren&#39;t there to soothe them.</span></p><p><span>i wish... i had... a piece... of you...</span>
<span>i wish... i had... told you... in time...</span></p><p><span>but i won&#39;t ever find you</span>
<span>and i won&#39;t ever love you</span></p><p><span>we were born in the wild</span>
<span>and in the wild we wil die</span></p><p><span>and i can&#39;t ever see you</span>
<span>each time that you die</span></p><p><span>we were found in the woods</span>
<span>and in the woods we will cry</span></p><p><span>i&#39;ll let you tie me down,</span>
