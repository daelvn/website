# new blood pt. I

I am scared when I look in the mirror
because I do not see myself.
Please, somebody tell me
what kind of monster have I become.

It feels like my body is not mine
and I do not recognize any of its
shapes in the dark of the night.
Please, somebody tell me who am I.

You are the true master
of the play, who controls all
the help that I received,
but your light is even darker than mine.

Why did the gods give wrath
to these that hate violence?
Do they wish to presence
my divine self-destruction so much?

Let me drink your blood
and kill me once for all.
Save me in your dead life.
New blood, new blood.

Make me of your kind,
and let me descend,
because here the stars shine so bright
I can't see myself.

Tell them to stop covering my eyes,
they only want to smother me.
Please, reveal it to me,
I must be alive for something else.

New blood, new blood,
I only want to live
so it can rain again.
I do put my faith in you.

They are who manipulate me,
 they use me as a window
 and through it they make me kneel.
 Make it stop, make it stop.

 They take control of my body
 and with it they control me,
 with it they hurt me.
 Make it stop, make it stop.

 Master, I know that I am dying,
 you do not need to hide it,
 but I only ask you to save me,
 once again, from this situation.

 Hold my hand during
 the last breath of my life.
 You were born with me and you will go with me:
 the blessing of he who opens portals.

 Let me drink your blood
 so I may go with you,
 meet with my true progenitor.
 New blood, new blood.

 **I want to hurt it**
 **and I want it to hurt.**
