<h1><a name="alone" class="md-header-anchor"></a><span>alone</span></h1><p><span>It is raining again.</span></p><p><span>But the rain is always welcome in this forest.</span>
<span>It freshens the air, keeps the cycle going.</span></p><p><span>It washes away the flesh from my bones,</span>
<span>where my body rests.</span></p><p><span>I only died once.</span>
<span>The trees guard my body.</span>
<span>The stars guard my soul.</span>
<span>The clouds guard my will.</span>
<span>The moon guards my emotions.</span></p><p><span>But death does not have to be painful.</span>
<span>Death can be beautiful.</span>
<span>Death can be a celebration.</span>
<span>To life, to a dream, to a project…</span>
<span>There are so many things to celebrate,</span>
<span>yet we focus in those that we do not.</span></p><p><span>I bring death to those who deserve it.</span>
<span>The joy of death is equivalent to the joy of life,</span>
<span>no matter how contradictory that sounds.</span></p><p><span>Because we all live on…</span>
<span>and the people who feel complete</span>
<span>will receive death to enjoy their completeness,</span>
<span>and the people who got redeemed</span>
<span>will receive deathto enjoy their change.</span></p><p><span>But their relatives will mourn, and truth be told, so do I.</span>
<span>I mourn the magnificent lives of the people I bring with me.</span>
<span>I mourn the memories that may break or disappear.</span>
<span>But I am not aftraid, or sad.</span>
<span>I know that they will be happy when I reach for them.</span>
<span>Because none of us want to die until we are dying.</span>
<span>Then, even if we do not show it at all, we crave for release</span>
<span>even just a little.</span>
<span>We crave for curiosity,</span>
<span>we crave for more.</span></p><p><span>And people have invented all sorts of</span>
<span>myths and tales to cope with death.</span>
<span>But death has mostly remained something taboo.</span>
<span>We need an other side. We need to know</span>
<span>that we are not simply gone.</span></p><p><span>Perhaps,</span>
<span>perhaps we are not.</span></p><p><span>People have invented tales about me,</span>
<span>about other angels,</span>
<span>about demons,</span>
<span>about good,</span>
<span>and evil,</span>
<span>about a benevolent god,</span>
<span>about a punisher deity,</span>
<span>about salvation,</span>
<span>about reincarnation.</span></p><p><span>If you seek salvation you will find it in yourself,</span>
<span>for you are the only one that can save you.</span>
<span>I can only take you when you are ready,</span>
<span>but I will take you where completeness is not</span>
<span>something you achieve…</span>
<span>but something you are.</span></p><p><span>You can be light.</span>
<span>You can be pure.</span>
<span>You can be free.</span></p><p><strong><span>I am Azrael, the Angel of Death.</span></strong></p>
