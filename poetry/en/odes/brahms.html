<h1><a name="to-the-brahms-lullaby" class="md-header-anchor"></a><span>to the brahms&#39; lullaby</span></h1><p><span>Sing to the night,</span>
<span>sing to the moon,</span>
<span>be the new angel</span>
<span>that guards my cradle.</span></p><p><span>I wish I had counted</span>
<span>all the dreams</span>
<span>that you guided me through</span>
<span>when we were younger.</span></p><p><span>Your melody continued</span>
<span>to resonate in my head,</span>
<span>when I had to cry</span>
<span>at night, silently.</span></p><p><span>But one day you got lost</span>
<span>and I couldn&#39;t find you again.</span>
<span>You were spinning in my head</span>
<span>and one day I lost track.</span></p><p><span>You were art so I left,</span>
<span>and worldwide I searched for you.</span>
<span>Where are you, my angel?</span>
<span>Even to Italy I will go.</span></p><p><span>And when I found you</span>
<span>I broke in tears,</span>
<span>I hugged you and told you</span>
<span>that in my pocket you would be safe.</span></p><p><span>Now when I listen</span>
<span>and I do it carefully,</span>
<span>I still hear your voice,</span>
<span>glorious in my mind.</span></p><p><strong><span>But you are a soul</span></strong>
<strong><span>and in my head you&#39;re present.</span></strong></p><blockquote><p><span>when i was young, i had a bunny stuffed plush. you could pull it and it would play a lullaby until i fell asleep. the music box was inside the head, and the bunny hung from my shelf so i could pull it before going to sleep. as i grew up, it had to be put away, and when i tried to get it back from the attic, it was filled with insect eggs. after me crying a lot, we had to throw it away. many years later, i had a school trip to Florence, Italy, and i entered a gift shop next to Il Duomo. there were some music boxes, labelled, and i played them one by one… until the last one… i played the first seconds of it, only to be overwhelmed with emotion and memories. i immediately bought the music box and started crying in that shop. i finally found it again, the nameless lullaby. Brahms&#39; lullaby.</span></p></blockquote>
