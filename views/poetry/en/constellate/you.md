# you

thinking about you wears me down
and i feel like i melt with the sheets of my bed
when i think you’re by my side

i’ve been destroying myself to find you in all of this
placing my arms under a razor blade
to find out if you’re under my skin

maybe if i break my carbon frame enough
i’ll find my peace
i’ll find you
