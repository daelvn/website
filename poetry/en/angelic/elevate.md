# elevate my body

elevate my body
float me to the moon
i did all that i wanted
and i am ready to go

i was born to the moonlight
and when we first met Him.
now i will turn into light
and reunite with my satellite

elevate my body
as i grow wings
and become what i once destroyed
it cannot be helped

golden shards float around me
and form the halo that will
be my window back to life.
i am ready to go.

elevate my body
as the bells ring,
as the piano plays,
as the music box sounds.

my lifeless corpse turns into the fog
that covers the mountains of this land.
my last tears turn into the rivers
that feed into the neverending sea.

elevate my body
i will breathe in peace
i can feel how i disintegrate
and my energy goes back to earth

i am creation and i paid my debt
nothing but my heart remains
when i observe from the clouds
what i used to call my home

elevate my body
as i leave this forest
i have no reason to be sad
it is how i wanted to go, after all

my emotions feed into the stardust
that makes the universe look as it does.
it will carry on even if
i already consumed my last breath

elevate my body
as i prepare to reign the skies
i am my own god
i have always been

i will place my translucent feet
on the clouds up above
but my hair will reach for
the stars millions of miles away

elevate my body
as the Third waves goodbye
i know i have made someone happy
while i was in life

i will use my quill
to tell the tales of the angel
that once walked the earth
to learn to be impure

there's nothing left now
my body might be buried
but my soul will stay up here
waving welcome to anyone who thinks of them

oh, what have i left in earth,
nothing but my fading memory.
my fate is with the stars
as it always should have been.

**because i have turned into my progenitors**
**and into the land they walked.**
