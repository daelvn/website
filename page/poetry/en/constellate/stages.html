<h1><a name="stages" class="md-header-anchor"></a><span>stages</span></h1><p><span>Start of the day:</span>
<span>I don&#39;t want to die</span>
<span>but I never want to try.</span>
<span>They say destiny is mine,</span>
<span>but why would I ever wanna say goodbye?</span></p><p><span>An art piece, a masterpiece</span>
<span>that some say it&#39;s me,</span>
<span>always up for going there,</span>
<span>never down to be here.</span></p><p><span>Could be walking down the streets,</span>
<span>visit the place I want to leave.</span>
<span>Just want to die somewhere else,</span>
<span>I&#39;m really such a mess.</span></p><p><span>Somewhere I would rather be</span>
<span>is something you all can dream.</span>
<span>Identity as a sin,</span>
<span>destruction: incomplete.</span></p><p><span>Shivers take my spine,</span>
<span>all my fears, they&#39;re combined.</span>
<span>A poem in a frame,</span>
<span>someone thinks it&#39;s lame.</span></p><p><span>Achievements, finish lanes,</span>
<span>a race that never ends,</span>
<span>a future that never bends,</span>
<span>I can&#39;t ever find my friends.</span></p><p><span>Broken poets, blank poems,</span>
<span>empty words in this mode and</span>
<span>will you find the code?</span>
<span>To my prison, 101 is the node</span>
<span>that connects it all,</span>
<span>pictures in this hall,</span>
<span>a hole in my wall,</span>
<span>that my heart used to escape the cage,</span>
<span>avoid decay, broken veins,</span>
<span>the mind that wanted fame,</span>
<span>boxed in a frame, always the same</span>
<span>I say</span></p><p><span>Second verse:</span></p><p><span>I don&#39;t want to feel,</span>
<span>stuck in the loop, &quot;it&#39;s not real&quot;.</span>
<span>If I would have myself,</span>
<span>I would have someone to kill.</span></p><p><span>Sometimes all things, others nothing,</span>
<span>never something, makes you think.</span>
<span>I haven&#39;t had a drink,</span>
<span>I still believe in dreams.</span></p><p><span>Am I still a kid,</span>
<span>or am I allowed to leave?</span>
<span>Don&#39;t take my life away</span>
<span>just take it from him.</span></p><p><span>There&#39;s the line,</span>
<span>it&#39;s not mine.</span>
<span>Unallowed to decide,</span>
<span>I never take pride.</span></p><p><span>Counting down each verse,</span>
<span>a text that is so terse.</span>
<span>&quot;Must be something but it&#39;s nothing,</span>
<span>so I just go back to bed&quot;.</span></p><p><span>Crying in the floor,</span>
<span>noone opened the door.</span>
<span>Meanwhile someone gets poor</span>
<span>and we say it&#39;s a small world.</span></p><p><span>Finding hope in songs,</span>
<span>that talk about the Lord.</span>
<span>Do I really believe in</span>
<span>someone else but my mom?</span></p><p><span>She&#39;s there, just asleep,</span>
<span>can&#39;t feel anything but my limbs,</span>
<span>I shaved the other day,</span>
<span>an order to take away.</span></p><p><span>Preparation to start your day,</span>
<span>but never help to finish them.</span>
<span>Hoping for a new sun,</span>
<span>I just feel so down</span></p><p><span>By the end of the day...</span></p>
