<h1><a name="you-win" class="md-header-anchor"></a><span>you win</span></h1><p><span>you&#39;ve got what you wanted.</span>
<span>even though it&#39;s gone now,</span>
<span>you know that you won</span>
<span>in the depths of my mind.</span></p><p><span>now with each passing day</span>
<span>i crave more for interaction,</span>
<span>but i&#39;m being left alone</span>
<span>by the people i used to trust.</span></p><p><span>and that is when you made your move,</span>
<span>in the moment i most need someone to talk,</span>
<span>you creep in my mind,</span>
<span>waiting for me to come back to you.</span></p><p><span>a message so carefully crafted</span>
<span>so you know i&#39;d be back in barely a month</span>
<span>even though your last messages</span>
<span>would beg to differ.</span></p><p><span>but you got rid of these too,</span>
<span>don&#39;t worry, i got pictures</span>
<span>to remind myself how much you really hate me</span>
<span>before sending you the first message.</span></p><p><span>so if you are reading my words</span>
<span>i&#39;ll let you know that you won.</span>
<span>i can&#39;t get you out of my mind</span>
<span>and every night i&#39;m at the border of messaging you.</span></p><p><span>the only thing left stopping me</span>
<span>are my few friends who know about this</span>
<span>but it won&#39;t last long</span>
<span>and my barriers are going to fall.</span></p><p><span>is this what you really wanted?</span>
<span>to see me suffer yet again?</span>
<span>i had forgotten about you,</span>
<span>i thought i had made it alive.</span></p><p><span>but oh i was so wrong,</span>
<span>little did i know you would come back</span>
<span>to haunt me in all of my dreams,</span>
<span>if i even get them anymore.</span></p><p><strong><span>you win.</span></strong>
<strong><span>see you soon.</span></strong></p>
