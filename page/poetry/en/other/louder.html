<h1 id="louder">louder</h1>
<p>louder, louder, louder.
i need enough noise to
drown all my thoughts away.
all of them.</p>
<p>louder, louder, louder.
i wish it were loud
enough to somehow
stop me from thinking altogether.</p>
<p>louder, louder, louder.
i need it to be loud enough
to stop existing,
to vanish somehow.</p>
<p>louder, louder, louder.
i need it to be loud enough
so i stop feeling my body,
even if just for one song.</p>
<p>louder, louder, louder
than the sounds i hear
when my vocal chords
twitch and talk.</p>
<p>louder, louder, louder,
i need it to be loud enough
so i don't even hear them,
so i don't even hear myself.</p>
<p>LOUDER, LOUDER, LOUDER.
I WANT TO HEAR NOTHING
BUT NOISE, BUT SPIKES,
SO MY EARS MIGHT JUST FAIL.</p>
<p>LOUDER, LOUDER, LOUDER.
SO THEY ARE SPEAKERS
POINTING RIGHT TO MY EARS,
SO THEY MIGHT JUST BREAK.</p>
<p>LOUDER, LOUDER, LOUDER.
SO GOD MAY HEAR MY NAME
WHEN I BLOW UP TO PIECES
FROM ALL OF THIS PAIN.</p>
<p>LOUDER, LOUDER, LOUDER.
SO THE ANGELS WHISPER
MY NAME TO EACH OTHER,
AS IF A RANCID RUMOR.</p>
<p>LOUDER, LOUDER, LOUDER.
SO THE EARTH MIGHT CRACK
AND I CAN FALL THROUGH
AND MELT WITH IT.</p>
<p>LOUDER, LOUDER, LOUDER.
SO DEMONS WILL CRY ME,
BUT THEIR TEARS WOULD VANISH,
FROM ALL THIS NOISE.</p>
<p>LOUDER, LOUDER, LOUDER.
SO WHEN THE NOISE STOPS,
ALL ON EARTH KNOW
WHAT HAPPENED TO ME.</p>
<p>LOUDER, LOUDER, LOUDER.
SO WHEN THEY CALL MY NAME,
IT WILL BECOME NOTHING.
NOTHING BUT NOISE.</p>
<p>BUT IT DOESN'T GET ANY MORE LOUDER.
THAN MY LUNGS CAN SCREAM.</p>
