<span>path that you&#39;ve taken</span>
<span>because oh, i know you are.</span>
<span>i am your only game.</span></p><p><span>it was into may when</span>
<span>you decided you got bored,</span>
<span>and needed something</span>
<span>for the sake of your own entertainment.</span></p><p><span>i&#39;m growing stronger</span>
<span>with every single minute that passes.</span>
<span>and i refuse to be your angel,</span>
<span>not your savior anymore.</span></p><p><span>you won&#39;t entice me with</span>
<span>any carefully crafted words</span>
<span>that you may have for me.</span>
<span>no apology will save you now.</span></p><p><span>you had been abusing me,</span>
<span>manipulating me, and got me</span>
<span>to believe things i just can&#39;t</span>
<span>believe ever came out of my hands.</span></p><p><span>so stop trying to appeal to</span>
<span>my known weaknesses,</span>
<span>to the things i used to enjoy</span>
<span>and you destroyed for me.</span></p><p><span>you don&#39;t deserve any</span>
<span>more affection from me,</span>
<span>so i will die as soon as possible,</span>
<span>just as you told me.</span></p><p><span>i don&#39;t care what you have,</span>
<span>it was eating me inside,</span>
<span>it was killing me not for</span>
<span>you to pretend i&#39;m healed now.</span></p><p><span>you ruined romance for me</span>
<span>i&#39;m that stupid useless scumbag</span>
<span>you hate so much.</span>
<span>choke on your own words.</span></p><p><span>[unfinished]</span></p><p><span>[and if someone&#39;s reading this, i simply couldn&#39;t continue]</span>
<span>[it&#39;s not my first language, and my mind is all a mess]</span>
<span>[i just can&#39;t write anything coherent about this right now]</span>
<span>[i still need time to process]</span>
<span>[but if you did read it, thank you so much]</span></p><p><span> </span><strong><span>// time does not heal but being alone does //</span></strong></p>
