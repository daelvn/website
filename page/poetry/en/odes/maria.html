<h1>María</h1>
<p>I saw you be happy,
before I left,
I talked to you,
because I wanted to farewell.</p>
<p>Not knowing that it would be
the last time I would see you,
because you never count on that.
We always pretend all goes on.</p>
<p>And you were not the person
I visited the most,
but you were not
the one I loved least either.</p>
<p>Because I still remember your face,
your color, your life, your house.
I still remember your voice, asking:
How are you? Is everything OK?</p>
<p>I still remember calling you,
even if just for a little bit.
I still remember loving you,
and seeing you walk in your house.</p>
<p>And when I got the news today,
I did not know how to feel except
the empathy for the people
that were around you.</p>
<p>Because I can assure you that
they will miss you,
they loved you too.
They cared for you as you did for them.</p>
<p>You were and will be an incredible
memory for me.
A small part dedicated
to thinking of you.</p>
<p>It is now empty,
but the echo of your voice carries on
and bounces off the walls of
my mind once and again.</p>
<p>God has a special
place for you,
there, so high up,
so you can finally rest.</p>
<p>We cry our solitude today
but I celebrate your life,
for being the greatgrandma
that your greatgrandchildren got to meet.</p>
<p>God save you
Your floating soul
Rest In Peace</p>
<p>María (12 Apr 2020)</p>
