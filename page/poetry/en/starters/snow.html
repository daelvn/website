<h1><a name="snow" class="md-header-anchor"></a><span>snow</span></h1><p><span>It only snows when there is</span>
<span>a reason to do so.</span>
<span>It only rains when there is</span>
<span>a path to be walked.</span></p><p><span>What will it be of me</span>
<span>when it does not rain again,</span>
<span>when the forest stops growing,</span>
<span>when I see the last leaf fall.</span></p><p><span>We will all regret what we didn&#39;t do</span>
<span>and what we could do.</span>
<span>What we did not avoid</span>
<span>and what will make us perish.</span></p><p><span>And when an animal eats</span>
<span>from your hand you will tell me</span>
<span>that you couldn&#39;t,</span>
<span>that you had to kill them.</span></p><p><span>And when a thunder falls</span>
<span>on your garden you&#39;ll tell me</span>
<span>that you are cursed,</span>
<span>that you are a saint.</span></p><p><strong><span>We turn into our progenitors</span></strong>
<strong><span>and they turn into the dirt we walk.</span></strong></p>
