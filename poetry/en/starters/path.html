<h1><a name="path" class="md-header-anchor"></a><span>path</span></h1><p><span>The path starts in education</span>
<span>and the walkers are the children.</span>
<span>The horizon has no limit</span>
<span>and the sailors are the outlaws.</span></p><p><span>More than injured rebels</span>
<span>by the people who put them at shooting range.</span>
<span>They may think, but they</span>
<span>will never walk the path of oblivion.</span></p><p><span>Child, put on your shoes,</span>
<span>I&#39;ll take you on a walk.</span>
<span>If the parents don&#39;t do it,</span>
<span>someone will have to educate them instead.</span></p><p><span>Walk towards the beasts</span>
<span>and stab them with your knife.</span>
<span>If you don&#39;t do it,</span>
<span>someone will have to save us instead.</span></p><p><span>The miserable remains one</span>
<span>if nobody lets them walk.</span>
<span>Let them silence us, let them silence us,</span>
<span>we will start to shout.</span></p><p><span>Walker, there&#39;s always a way</span>
<span>as long as you make it be seen.</span>
<span>Walker, guide your steps</span>
<span>since in ten years we&#39;ll perish.</span></p><p><span>What is an unread book</span>
<span>but a pile of paper?</span>
<span>What is a forest without trees</span>
<span>but a place to build?</span></p><p><span>History repeats itself</span>
<span>because they want it to repeat.</span>
<span>These cries repeat themselves</span>
<span>because nobody else cries for Earth.</span></p><p><strong><span>Walk towards the beasts</span></strong>
<strong><span>and someday you will come back.</span></strong></p>
