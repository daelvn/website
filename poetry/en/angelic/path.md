It has happened again.

I have school tomorrow, and I got in bed
early into the night, around 8, as always.
I would get in my bed, perhaps even peek out
a bit to see whatever my parents were watching,
then I would go talk to them.

I was in so much pain, and they understood,
and they helped,
and they gave me advice.
But once again, in the middle of my bed…
Once again, I had gotten on my knees.

> the four corners of my bed
> the four angels guarding it
> two by my hand
> two by my feet
> and the Virgin Mary, who is with me.

But nobody came…

NOBODY EVER CAME. NOBODY EVER CAME. NOBODY EVER CAME. NOBODY EVER CAME. NOBODY EVER CAME. NOBODY EVER CAME. NOBODY EVER CAME. NOBODY EVER CAME. NOBODY EVER CAME. NOBODY EVER CAME. NOBODY EVER CAME.
