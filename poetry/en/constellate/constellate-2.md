# constellate pt. II

Tell me how far
I am from your head.
Tell me how far
you are from loving me.

So many nights
building my castles.
So many fights
going on in my mind.

I don't understand
why I can't love you.
Maybe I do,
but I don't accept it.

How can I really be so na√Øve?
How could I really do this to me?
Tell me why, tell me why.

And I would move the stars,
I would arrange the sky
for us
to constellate.

And I would be so proud
to die on your way.
A fake illusion,
to constellate.

Perhaps I don't get it at all.
Perhaps I don't know what's going on.
In the sky. In our sky.

// Because it's a pleasure to share //
// and to constellate //
