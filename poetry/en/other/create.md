# I WILL CREATE

I WANT TO CREATE
BUT I DESTROY EVERYTHING
THAT COMES TO MY MIND

PERHAPS YELLING IS THE ONLY
THING THAT CANNOT BE FILTERED
I WANT TO ESCAPE

I WILL CREATE
NO MATTER HOW MUCH I TRY TO STOP MYSELF
BECAUSE I AM BOUND TO GIVE TO THE WORLD

I WILL CREATE
BECAUSE I CANNOT REATAIN MY FEELINGS
FOR MUCH MORE TIME

I WILL CREATE
BECAUSE EVERYTHING I DO DESERVES
TO BE SEEN AND APPRECIATED

I WILL CREATE
BECAUSE I AM MY OWN CREATION
I AM A GOD TO MYSELF

I WILL GET RID OF ALL MY FILTERS
I WILL STOP CARING ABOUT OTHERS' OPINION
I WILL DESTROY DESTRUCTION FOREVER

I WILL CREATE A BETTER ME
I WILL CREATE THE BEST OF ME
I WILL MAKE MY EXISTENCE ART

I AM CREATION
AND CREATION IS ART
I WILL NOT BE BOUND TO A SINGLE CANVAS

**I WILL CREATE FOR MYSELF**
**OPINIONS ARE A CONSEQUENCE**
