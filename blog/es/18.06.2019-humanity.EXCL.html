  <summary><strong>content warning: my take on humanity, gender mention, possible mild dysphoria</strong></summary>
  <p>
    (0) so this is something i've been wanting to do for a while. and it's uh, my take on humanity and the concept of it. it's going to be a long thread, so brace yrselves because we're going for a ride. it's going to be pretty uh, philosophical, so beware. i'll try to boil it down as much as possible for everyone to understand, tho.<br><br>
    (1) so basically, we kinda take the concept of humanity for granted, we all know what it is and all but i believe there's more to it than we see. it's not only a matter of existence, it's also a matter of autonomy and rulings. i think of "humanity" like i think of gender and sex. unfortunately, we're born into a certain sex, and that carries many connotations for us, which is what society makes of it, "gender", so it is assigned to you at birth (eugh)<br><br>
    (2) so gender is all about what humans make of sex, it has a set of "commonly accepted" rules that you are expected to follow simply because you were born with certain genitalia. now, i've been able to find myself in a supportive and accepting community, that allows me to break with the concept of gender, but not everyone is. along the dysphoria i've suffered, it's one of the reasons i am non-binary. but how does it relate to humanity?<br><br>
    (3) we have to set the difference between being human and humanity. assuming most of the readers here are born Homo Sapiens (super rad if you, somehow, aren't), and that's, unfortunately, biological. so by being born *human*, there is a certain set of base expectations that are assigned to you, which are "humanity"<br><br>
    (4) i've expressed this discontent in some of my poems. who says what is human and what is not? is it really? who are they to tell me? thing is, none of us agreed to it, just like none of us really agreed to our assigned gender (cis people got it "picked" and accepted it, nothing wrong with that, but they still didn't agree per se). but rejecting labels does not work for everybody, but for those of us that work, i think there's something liberating to it.<br><br>
    (5) i'd like to clarify that it isn't something i've really gotten into, i'm not as experienced or well-versed in this as kins/therians/others, and solely talk from my own experience and point of view. i'm sure people have their own ways of viewing it, after all, you're the only one who can set your own rules.<br><br>
    (6) you can reject your humanity, and what, in my opinion, makes it so horrible, you can break from it. you're the only one able to define what it's like to be you. it's about time to define ourselves, escape from the concept of "that's inhumane" or "very human", it's all dictated by a society with expectations of you, and you don't have to meet them.<br><br>
    (7) older generations, at least in western culture, have been caring about this for long enough, and it's time that we don't give an uh... we don't care about it. it's time to give ourself the right to self-determination. so what if i'm not human? if i want, i can. you go first, you matter too. we have to ditch the concept of humanity and play by our own rules, escape from the hypocrisy and failures of what is it like to be human. it won't be the same rules for everyone, only those that work for you<br><br>
    (8) so in my close group of friends, they're fine with it, they're fine with me being nb and that i call myself non-human. perhaps others are fine with being human, but i've been meeting others' expectations for too long, and it's time i do only what i feel comfortable with. thanks to my poems i've also been able to channel my emotions and cope with these feelings<br><br>
    (9) so to close off, be you, do whatever you want, play by your own rules, don't meet others' expectations. defy all boundaries and conventions. you are the only person that can define yourself and we have got to acknowledge that.<br><br>
    (10) though, if anyone wants to express their own point of view, i'm more than happy to hear about it, i'd love to know more about all of this! this is just how it feels inside me, and i'm sure others differ on this. if you read this all, thank you! and have a nice day!<br><br>
