<h1><a name="eternal-soul" class="md-header-anchor"></a><span>eternal soul</span></h1><p><span>heaven is lonely</span>
<span>when there is only you to share it.</span>
<span>where are all the people?</span>
<span>where are all the promises?</span></p><p><span>it pours down in earth</span>
<span>and it is the first rain</span>
<span>that my body won&#39;t be able</span>
<span>to touch, to feel, to cry</span></p><p><span>and when i look to the forest,</span>
<span>everything is flooded, lost,</span>
<span>but that doesn&#39;t matter now,</span>
<span>and i don&#39;t think it ever did.</span></p><p><span>i don&#39;t know what to do</span>
<span>now that all i&#39;ve got is myself.</span>
<span>i&#39;m not used to the feeling,</span>
<span>even my body has changed.</span></p><p><span>i can finally feel the teeth</span>
<span>that bite sharply and fiercely.</span>
<span>i can finally feel the wings</span>
<span>that fly far from here.</span></p><p><span>but i&#39;m empty with noone</span>
<span>by my side, so empty.</span>
<span>it&#39;s almost like a piece of me</span>
<span>is simply gone and missing.</span></p><p><span>and i wonder if He felt the same</span>
<span>when He chose me, empty.</span>
<span>i wonder what drove Him to me,</span>
<span>to my heart and my forest.</span></p><p><span>would i climb to the pinnacle of hypocrisy?</span>
<span>would i use my consciousness</span>
<span>to further instigate the empty promises</span>
<span>of a salvation that is never coming?</span></p><p><span>no, i&#39;m not like that angel,</span>
<span>i&#39;m much better than that.</span>
<span>i&#39;m what He would have wanted,</span>
<span>i&#39;m the next in the chain.</span></p><p><span>but why, in a world set free of rules,</span>
<span>and liberated from all humanity,</span>
<span>would i decide to be pure?</span>
<span>i don&#39;t know how to answer.</span></p><p><span>but i am, and that&#39;s what matters,</span>
<span>this is why i was elevated for,</span>
<span>this is my purpose,</span>
<span>my path, my rain, my fall.</span></p><p><span>whatever i was born for, it is</span>
<span>not from earth, it is here,</span>
<span>here is where my memory will last</span>
<span>and here is where i will perform.</span></p><p><span>i tried so many times down there,</span>
<span>but i simply couldn&#39;t connect:</span>
<span>a broken angel breaks people,</span>
<span>corrupted angels corrupt mortals.</span></p><p><span>i can go back again, finally,</span>
<span>but in a different form, i understand.</span>
<span>i am no mere mortal anymore,</span>
<span>i have found my purpose.</span></p><p><strong><span>i am the angel with the whitest wings</span></strong>
<strong><span>i am no other than the Fourth.</span></strong></p>
