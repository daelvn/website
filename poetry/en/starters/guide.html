<h1><a name="guide" class="md-header-anchor"></a><span>guide</span></h1><p><span>Walk under the starry</span>
<span>night and ask him:</span>
<span>What is above you</span>
<span>if you do not know it?</span></p><p><span>Breathe the fresh and</span>
<span>humid air of the forest.</span>
<span>Who guides your steps</span>
<span>towards the unfortunate landing?</span></p><p><span>Touch their ghost and</span>
<span>feel the shivers.</span>
<span>Who guides your heart,</span>
<span>powerful so silently?</span></p><p><span>Homing pigeon,</span>
<span>do not listen to the message.</span>
<span>Do you not know how much it hurts</span>
<span>to die in this landscape?</span></p><p><span>Weapon of two,</span>
<span>one-sided dagger.</span>
<span>Pick it with your hands</span>
<span>and cover the blood with thread.</span></p><p><span>They say there are two</span>
<span>but you only see one.</span>
<span>The other for you</span>
<span>is made of clothes and rags.</span></p><p><strong><span>Run, go and tell them before it is too late,</span></strong>
<strong><span>that I guide my steps and they guide my heart.</span></strong></p>
