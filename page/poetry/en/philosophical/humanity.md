# humanity

Humanity is a convention
none of us agreed to.
Look at my face and tell me
whether I am some kind of defaced monster.

Stare at my lifeless gaze and tell me
what is inside of me,
if there is,
and if there is, whether you call it human.

What is being human but
a set of rules,
of prejudices, of conventions
that they say we have to follow?

What does it mean to be a person?
Who says so?
How much do they reign over my soul
to tell me so?

It is a big deceit,
a deception,
they only dehumanize
when they feel they have to.

But they all were human,
the murderers and the genocidal,
and at the same time none of us is,
only because they say so.

Then I am not human,
I refuse, I will not bow down,
anything but that.
You won't hear me say I'm human.

I say I have wings
but that you can't see them.
I say I have fangs
but that I won't bite you.

Feel my breeze,
feel the power
of having the domain of oneself
and not get lost.

**Because I am like a wolf to people**
**and people are like wolves to me.**
