# a pencil

a pencil is all you need
to start a revolution.
two people, all you need
to share an emotion.

the sea is not deep
if you only float in it.
nobody is going to complain
as long as they get well fed.

what you see nor what you hear
can be trusted, you don't know it.
there's more than one perspective,
and some take it to their deathbed.

if you wake up and seeing hurts,
don't stop seeing, improve what you see.
an empty hand doesn't give warmth
but it's better if it's more than a hundred.

i share my message,
i leave myself in debt,
to give that warmth
to the people surrounded by ice.

what we create is a mirror
that reflects reality just as
we see it,
and i have many.

if you are like me, free,
and don't adhere to conventional rules.
you understand this message as a whole.
you might be like me but always you.

and if the kids don't know
that we're there for them
they will have to start from scratch,
suffering and from the beginning.
