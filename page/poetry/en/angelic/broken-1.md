# broken pt. I

i'm fallen<span style="position: relative; top: 3px; left: -63px;">i'm fallen</span>
but i don't know where i belong
everything about me disgusts me
but i'm recovering my senses

i'm going back to the person
that i'm supposed to be
i really need food
i really need to feed on someone

i really need some blood
i cannot go on like this
i have no energy left
i'm the empty vessel of something great

i'm broken<span style="position: relative; top: 3px; left: -63px;">i'm broken</span>
and to no path i belong
for i am forging my own
with my tears of stone

i am bound to mortal rules
unholy desires
that make me impure
yet i pretend to live on like this.
