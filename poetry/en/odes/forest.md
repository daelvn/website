# to the forest

i found a log
between all the trees.
one that's broken, fallen
so i could sit.

the sun is setting where i am,
but i don't know where that is.
time has passed,
i don't know what i'll do today.

because when i look around,
and i see how far i've gotten,
i don't believe i'm
sitting on this tree.

i don't even know the leaves
falling in the autumn.
i only know it is the most
beautiful thing i've ever seen.

because i walk through it
and i hear a distant melody,
that tells me to
sing it, whistle it.

because i walk through it
and i smell the smoke
of wood, so unique,
so full and peculiar.

here i am,
among several logs,
among angels
of my kind.

because i see every
soul that hides
here, in this forest,
and call me to fly wit them.

i've cried so many times,
trapped for so many days,
and here i am,
alone in this forest.

so that now i cry of happiness,
i'm where i wanted to be.
a bit of luck,
a bit of effort.

**to get lost in a forest**
**and not look back.**
